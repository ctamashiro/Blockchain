Used C++ to design a basic blockchain ledger system to simulate fundamental concepts such as block linking, hash validation, and data integrity. 
Implemented by using a custom doubly linked list to store the user's input data, and utilized the ASCII system to convert the userâ€™s content into
an integer hash value.
